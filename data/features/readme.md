Contains derived dataset: "LAKE [26] dataset includes nuclear transcriptomic data for >60,000 single cells from106human adult visual cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellum from six different individuals.107For each gene, we take an average of all the expression in all cell types and states (with108labels provided in the dataset) to reduce the dimension of this dataset.  We obtain a109matrix with 61 columns, and use this matrix as features for training"
